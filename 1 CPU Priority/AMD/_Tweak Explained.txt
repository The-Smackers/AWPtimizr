Registry Tweak Explained:

Path: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Multimedia\SystemProfile\Tasks\Games

Changes:
"GPU Priority"=dword:00000008: Boosts GPU priority to 8 (default varies, often 0 or lower).

"Priority"=dword:00000006: Sets task priority to 6 (high, default is ~2-3).

"Scheduling Category"="High": Forces high-priority scheduling (default is “Medium”).

"SFIO Priority"="High": Elevates storage I/O priority (default is “Normal”).

Effect: Optimizes CS2—more GPU/CPU focus, faster I/O (e.g., map or video loading).

Is It Okay? Safety?

Stability: These tweaks don’t directly touch kernel memory or drivers. They adjust scheduling, not memory allocation, so they’re unlikely to cause a BSOD.

Driver Interaction: No direct risk to NVIDIA, or FACEIT Anti-Cheat drivers. They might stress drivers indirectly under extreme load (e.g., Topaz + gaming).

FACEIT Anti-Cheat: FAC scans for suspicious tweaks, but these are standard gaming optimizations Microsoft supports. No ban risk—users on forums (e.g., Reddit, FACEIT threads) report using similar settings without issues.

Effectiveness?

Diminishing Returns: Windows 11’s scheduler is already game-optimized (e.g., Game Mode). These tweaks might give 5-15 FPS or reduce stutters under load, but don’t expect miracles unless you’re multitasking heavily.

Risks?

Heat: Maxing CPU/GPU priority might raise temps slightly under load (e.g., 5-10°C), but your rig likely has solid cooling.

Could It Cause BSOD?

Unlikely: These tweaks don’t touch drivers or memory layout—they’re scheduling adjustments.

Edge Case: If CS2’s priority starves a driver’s thread while another program maxes resources, it could theoretically stress something into failing. But this is a stretch.

My Take? Is It Okay?

Yes, it’s safe and reasonable for CS2/FACEIT. These are common gaming tweaks (seen on X posts, Reddit, and optimization guides) with low risk.

Recommendation: Apply them, but tweak Priority down to 4 or 3 if you notice background lag in other programs.
