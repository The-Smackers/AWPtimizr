Proposed Changes:

Disable WbioSrvc (if no biometrics).
Disable GraphicsPerfSvc, stisvc, WerSvc, PcaSvc, Wecsvc (all irrelevant for gaming).

Explained: 
1. Windows Biometric Service (WbioSrvc)
Purpose: Handles fingerprint/face login (Windows Hello).

Default: Manual (3).

Risk: Breaks Windows Hello login if you use it (e.g., fingerprint scanner). Safe otherwise.

Okay?: Yes, if you don’t use biometrics. No BSOD risk.

2. Graphics Performance Monitor Service (GraphicsPerfSvc)
Purpose: Monitors GPU performance for telemetry (e.g., Task Manager stats).

Default: Manual (3).

Risk: None significant—purely telemetry. NVIDIA’s tools (e.g., GeForce Experience) cover this.

Okay?: Yes, safe to disable. No BSOD risk, minimal gain.

3. Windows Image Acquisition (stisvc)
Purpose: Supports scanners/cameras (e.g., photo import).

Default: Manual (3).

Risk: Breaks scanner/camera apps if you use them. Safe for gaming-only PCs.

Okay?: Yes, if no imaging devices. No BSOD concern.

4. Windows Error Reporting Service (WerSvc)
Purpose: Collects crash data (e.g., BSOD logs) for Microsoft.

Default: Manual (3).

Risk: No error reports sent to Microsoft. Local dumps (e.g., C:\Windows\Minidump) still generate, but you lose automated feedback.

Okay?: Yes, safe. Your BSOD analysis (Event Viewer) isn’t affected. Minor resource save.

5. Program Compatibility Assistant Service (PcaSvc)
Purpose: Suggests compatibility fixes for old apps.

Default: Manual (3).

Risk: No compatibility popups for old apps. No stability hit.

Okay?: Yes, fine to disable. No BSOD tie.

6. Windows Event Collector (Wecsvc)
Purpose: Forwards event logs to remote servers (enterprise use).

Default: Manual (3).

Risk: Breaks event forwarding if you use it (unlikely). Safe otherwise.

Okay?: Yes, pointless on a gaming rig. No BSOD risk.

Safety?

BSOD Risk: None. These changes don’t touch drivers or memory—purely service control.

FACEIT Anti-Cheat: No issues. FAC allows service disabling (common in optimization guides on X/Reddit). These aren’t cheats.

Effectiveness?

Resource Gain: Minimal—combined, you might save 50-100MB RAM and <1% CPU at idle. CS2 won’t see a measurable FPS boost (it’s GPU/CPU-bound, not service-limited).

Real Benefit: Reduces background noise slightly, potentially smoothing CS2 under edge cases (e.g., Windows Update running). More placebo than game-changer with 32GB RAM.

Risks?

Feature Loss: Breaks biometrics, scanners, error reporting, etc., if you use them. No gaming impact since CS2 runs solo.

Topaz/ProtonVPN: Font cache disable might slow Topaz UI slightly (not performance). Others are irrelevant outside CS2.

Is It Okay?

Yes, with caveats:
Safe for CS2/FACEIT—no stability or anti-cheat issues.

Minor resource savings, not transformative for your high end rig.

Fine if you don’t need biometrics, scanners, or error reporting.

My Recommendation?

Apply Most: These are low-risk optimizations.
