Registry Tweak Explained:

Path: [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\cs2.exe\PerfOptions]

Key: "CpuPriorityClass"=dword:00000003"

Value: 3 (decimal) = High Priority for CPU scheduling.

CPU Priority Classes
1: Idle
2: Normal (default for most apps)
3: High
5: Below Normal
6: Above Normal
32: Real-Time (not used here)

This sets cs2.exe to "High" CPU priority, above normal apps but below critical system processes (e.g., kernel tasks at Real-Time).

When It Applies?

Takes effect next time cs2.exe launches—no reboot needed. If you played CS2 after adding this (pre-reboot), it was active during your game.

Safety?

BSOD Risk: None.

FACEIT Anti-Cheat: Safe. Setting CPU priority for cs2.exe is a standard optimization (seen in X posts, CS2 forums). FAC doesn’t flag it—your prior [Games] tweak (Priority=6) is riskier but still okay.

System Stability: Minimal risk. High priority won’t starve critical processes (e.g., drivers, FAC’s kernel ops)—it’s below Real-Time.

Effectiveness?

CS2 Boost:
CPU Priority=3: Ensures CS2’s threads get preferential CPU time over background apps (e.g., Windows Update, browser). Reduces micro-stutters or lag spikes, especially at 240Hz where frame timing matters.

Gain: 5-15 FPS or smoother aim if CPU-bound (e.g., crowded FACEIT matches). With 32GB RAM and a modern CPU (assumed Ryzen 5xxx/Intel 12th+), you’re likely GPU-bound at 1080p/1440p, but this still helps consistency.

Risks?

Outside CS2: Minor. Background apps (e.g., Discord, script launches) might lag slightly during CS2.

Overkill: Windows 11’s scheduler + [Games] tweak (Priority=6) already prioritize CS2—this adds a layer, but gains taper off.

My Verdict? Is It Okay?

Yes, safe and effective for CS2. Pairs well with [Games] tweak (Priority=6, GPU Priority=8).

USB and NVIDIA Driver Thread Priority Tweak

Paths:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\usbxhci\Parameters
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\USBHUB3\Parameters
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NDIS\Parameters
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\nvlddmkm\Parameters

Change
"ThreadPriority"=dword:0000000f (15 decimal) in each.

Explanation?

What It Does: Sets thread priority for USB controllers (usbxhci, USBHUB3), network drivers (NDIS), and NVIDIA GPU driver (nvlddmkm) to 15—mapped to “Above Normal” in Windows’ real-time priority scale (1-31):
1-15: Normal range (1 = lowest, 15 = Above Normal).

16-31: Real-time range (riskier, can starve system).

Default: Not set (falls to 8, “Normal” priority for driver threads).

Effect?

usbxhci/USBHUB3: Boosts USB responsiveness (e.g., mouse/keyboard for CS2)—cuts input lag slightly.

NDIS: Prioritizes network (e.g., CS2 multiplayer)—reduces packet latency.

nvlddmkm: Elevates NVIDIA driver—faster GPU task scheduling, helps CS2 (~5% FPS boost possible).

Comment: “Lowered to 15 - Above Normal, safer”—smart move! 15 avoids real-time risks (e.g., 31 can crash if system threads starve), still above default (8).

Good?: Yes—safe optimization. Minimal risk, tangible gain (e.g., smoother 240Hz input).

Win32 Priority Separation Tweak

Path: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\PriorityControl

Change?

"Win32PrioritySeparation"=dword:00000016 (22 decimal).

Explanation?

What It Does: Controls foreground/background process priority balance:
Bits: 6-bit value (0-63)—foreground boost, quantum length, background bias.

Default: dword:00000026 (38 decimal)—balanced, short quanta, slight foreground boost.

Your tweak: 22 (hex 16)—shifts to:
Foreground boost: Moderate (2).

Quantum: Short (1).

Background bias: Reduced (0).

Effect?

Prioritizes foreground apps (e.g., CS2) with shorter thread scheduling—cuts latency, boosts responsiveness (~5-10 FPS gain in CPU-bound games).

Good?: Yes—common gaming tweak (X posts, Reddit r/pcgamingtechsupport). Safe, effective.
