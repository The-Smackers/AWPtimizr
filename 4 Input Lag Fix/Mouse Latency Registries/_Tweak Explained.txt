Registry Tweak Explained:

Path: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Mouse (Multiple Entries):

"MouseSensitivity"=10": Default sensitivity.

"SmoothMouseXCurve"/"SmoothMouseYCurve": Custom curves for mouse smoothing (two conflicting sets).

HKEY_USERS.DEFAULT\Control Panel\Mouse:
"MouseSpeed"=0", "MouseThreshold1"=0", "MouseThreshold2"=0": No acceleration.

Safety?

BSOD Risk: None—user-level settings.

FACEIT: Safe—mouse tweaks are allowed.

Effectiveness?

CS2: Disables acceleration (good for aim consistency), custom curves adjust sensitivity feel.

Risk: No risk.

Okay?: Yes.
