A command-line tool to apply and revert common Windows and CS2 performance tweaks via registry and script files. VAC, VACnet and FACEIT Anti-Cheat safe.

## Features
- **CPU Tweaks**: AMD/Intel-specific optimizations.
- **Game Tweaks**: High priority and thread settings for CS2.
- **Services**: Disable unnecessary Windows services (Bluetooth, Xbox, etc. see Note #1).
- **Latency**: Dynamic tick, HPET, and synthetic timer adjustments. (AMD CPU only)
- **Network**: Firewall rules for CS2.
- **Graphics**: High-performance settings for CS2.
- **Input**: Mouse precision fixes and keyboard polling rate tweaks.
- **Debloat Windows**: See Note #1.
- **Clear DirectX Shader Cache**: And verifies CS2 files.
- **Revert Options**: Undo all or some changes.
- **Simulation Mode**: Test tweaks without applying.

## Usage
1. **Clone/Download**: Grab the repo or [download latest release](https://github.com/The-Smackers/AWPtimizr/releases) and unzip if needed.
2. **Run in terminal or click file**: (Prompts for Admin privileges)
   - `AWPtimizr.cmd`: Apply or Revert all changes/tweaks with prompts.
4. **Reboot**: Required after applying tuning tweaks or reverting tuning tweaks.

### Usage Notes
- Check `Summary_*/Optimization_Log.txt` after execution for a detailed run history.
- Backups are stored in the `Summary_*/Backup` subfolder.

### Usage Example
```cmd
Choose execution mode:
1: Prompt for each file (advanced)
2: Execute all automatically (default)
3: Skip all automatically (exit)
4: Simulate all (no changes applied)
5: Delete DirectX Shader Cache (fix for FPS loss)
Enter choice (1-5):

[1/10] [10%] Found: Disable_Telemetry.reg
Preview (p), Execute (e), or Skip (s)? e
[1/10] Applying: Disable_Telemetry.reg
[1/10] Success: Disable_Telemetry.reg
```

## Folder Structure
- `1_CPU\AMD\`: AMD-specific tweaks (e.g., `AMD_CPU_Priority.reg/Latency_Tweaks.cmd`).
- `2_Game\`: CS2 priority tweaks (e.g., `CS2_High_Priority.reg`).
- `3_Input\Mouse\`: Mouse tweaks (e.g., `Disable_Pointer_Precision_Globally_and_Fix_Delay.reg`).
- `3_Input\Keyboard\`: Keyboard tweaks (e.g., `5_Wooting_Latest_Keyboard.reg`).
- `4_Network\`: Network tweaks (e.g., `CS2_Firewall_Rules.cmd`).
- `5_Graphics\`: Graphics tweaks (e.g., `CS2_High_Performance.cmd`).
- `6_Features\`: Windows 11 tweaks (`Enable Taskbar End Task/Classic Right Click Menu`).
- `7_Debloat\`: Debloat Windows (e.g., `See Note #1`).
- `*/Revert\`: Revert scripts (e.g., `Revert_Latency_Tweaks.cmd`).

## Registry Tweaks
This repository includes a collection of `.reg` and `.cmd` files to disable various Windows features and services, along with corresponding revert files to restore default settings. All tweaks are designed for Windows 11 (tested against 23H2 defaults as of July 2025). Revert files have been updated to align with true Windows defaults (e.g., removing policy keys rather than setting them to enabling values).

**Notes:**
- HomeGroup and WiFi Sense tweaks are legacy; theyâ€™re no-ops in Windows 11 but included for older systems.
